### Overview
Project that as a team we decided on was a Unity third-person endless survival game. Main reason for us to go along with Unity engine was to try something new that wasn't taught on the course, but also to improve on newly learned programming language, C#.

### Description
The game is based on player spawning on randomly generated cave-like environment, and the main reason is to survive continuous waves of zombies. As the player will struggle shooting zombies with gun, player also be busy keeping eye on abilities and character panel statistics, as tougher enemies spawn every now and then. Through out the game player will be able to experience various features such as, character development, never ending waves of enemies, difficulty raise & map change with each new level, and much more.

### Key Features
* User friendly start up menu with ability to freely control screen size and music volume
* Randomly generated environment
* Endless waves of enemies
* Full control of in-game character with ability to:
  - Rotate freely around to gaze upon the environment
  - Move around the map
  - Shoot through hordes of enemies
* Character panel and ability system
* Leveling and currency systems
* Pause and game over menus
* Player death statistics
* Highscores
* Health and shield systems
* Raise of difficulty with each level
